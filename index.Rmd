I'm interested in Causality, Statistics, Godel's incompleteness theorem and Philosophy of Death, though I confess, I'm not an expert on one of them yet......

$$Y = \alpha \cdot \sin(X), \alpha = 0,0.1,0.2,...,3$$



```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(tidyverse)
cool_function <- function(x, alpha) return(sin(alpha*x))
xs <- seq(0, pi*1.5, 0.005)
ys <- cool_function(xs, 1)
results <- data_frame(xs, ys, alpha = "1")
for(alpha in seq(0,3, 0.1)){
  results <- results %>% 
    bind_rows(data_frame(
      xs, 
      ys = cool_function(xs, alpha),
      alpha = as.character(alpha)
    ))
}

ggplot(results, aes(x = xs, y = ys, color = alpha)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position="none")
